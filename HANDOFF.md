# Sales Note Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-12 KST

## Current Goal

The long-term goal is to unify the CRM frontend into React while keeping Django as the backend/API layer.

- React should become the only user-facing CRM frontend after feature parity.
- Django should remain responsible for login, permissions, models, business logic, files, and JSON APIs.
- Django template pages must remain usable during the transition.
- Do not copy the old Django visual design into React. Build a distinct internal CRM interface.
- Remove Django frontend templates only after React feature parity, Railway deployment, and manual production testing are complete.

## Current Task

Quote document grouping, generated document registration, automatic quote mail attachment, and registered document deletion are implemented, locally verified, pushed, deployed to production, and smoke-tested. User manual production testing is pending.

Runtime commit:

```text
0384e13 feat: split schedule quote documents by group
```

Implemented:

- `DeliveryItem.quote_group` stores which quote set each item belongs to, such as `보상판매` or `수리`.
- `DocumentGenerationLog.quote_group` stores which generated quote PDF belongs to which quote set.
- Quote schedule document actions are now split by quote group, so one schedule can register/download separate PDFs like `보상판매 견적서` and `수리 견적서`.
- Document preview/generation filters quotation items by `quote_group` and adds template variables `견적구분`, `견적명`, `견적제목`.
- Schedule mail auto-attachment attaches all registered quote PDFs for that schedule; if none exist, it auto-generates one PDF per quote group before sending.
- Generated PDF files for quotations, transaction statements, and delivery notes appear in the registered document list.
- React schedule detail can delete registered generated documents when the schedule owner has edit permission.
- New DB migration: `reporting/migrations/0097_quote_document_groups.py`.

## Older Task

React mailbox email line break normalization is implemented, locally verified, pushed, deployed to production, and smoke-tested. User manual production testing is pending.

Runtime commit:

```text
329cb0d fix: normalize mailbox email line breaks
```

- `_handle_email_send()` now normalizes `body_text` line endings from `\r\n`/`\r` to `\n` before validation, MIME send, HTML conversion, and EmailLog storage.
- Plain text → HTML conversion now escapes text and uses `<br>` for line breaks without `white-space: pre-wrap`.
- This removes the `\r<br>` + pre-wrap combination that could make one textarea newline render as multiple visual breaks in email clients.
- React mailbox send/reply, Gmail API, IMAP/SMTP, attachments, business card signatures, and EmailLog storage are preserved.
- No DB model or migration changes.

## Operating Rule From User

For each meaningful task:

1. Implement the scoped change.
2. Run local checks.
3. Commit and push.
4. Confirm Railway deployment for affected service(s).
5. Run production smoke checks.
6. Give the user a concrete manual server test process.
7. Continue with the next React integration work after the user confirms the test result.

The user has confirmed Railway access is available in this workspace.

## Production Services

- React frontend: `https://sales-note-frontend-production.up.railway.app`
- Django web/backend: `https://web-production-5096.up.railway.app`
- Railway project: `Sales-note`
- Railway environment: `production`
- Current Railway status at handoff:
  - `web`: Online
  - `sales-note-frontend`: Online
  - `Postgres`: Online

## Important Transition Decision

Until React integration is complete, keep Django pages open and usable.

The latest user clarification:

- Django pages must remain available for now.
- Django schedule calendar is a key operational page and must be easily accessible.
- React pages should have links back to Django pages while feature parity is incomplete.
- Only block/remove Django pages after the React replacement is complete and manually verified.

## Most Recent Confirmed Task

User confirmed manual test completion after the Django schedule calendar restoration.

Implemented behavior:

- Django sidebar `일정 캘린더` opens `/reporting/schedules/calendar/`.
- Django top quick action includes `일정 캘린더`.
- Django schedule list `/reporting/schedules/` includes `캘린더 보기` and `새 일정`.
- Existing schedule list and create/edit/detail behavior remains available.

Commits:

- `c0dc305 fix: restore Django schedule calendar entry`
- `3031ffd docs: record schedule calendar deployment`

Deployments:

- Functional deploy: `49085d5c-cd11-4dca-b9a3-35011ad7626d`
- Final online deploy after docs: `5fccc340-aa32-4a3c-b347-2e2ef73a4b6f`

Validation:

```powershell
python manage.py test reporting.tests.AuthenticationSmoke.test_schedule_calendar_authenticated reporting.tests.DashboardSmokeTests.test_django_sidebar_schedule_points_to_calendar reporting.tests.AnonymousAccessTests.test_schedule_calendar_blocked --verbosity=2
python manage.py test reporting.tests.AuthenticationSmoke reporting.tests.DashboardSmokeTests reporting.tests.AnonymousAccessTests --verbosity=1
python manage.py check
python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
git diff --check
```

Results:

- 3 targeted tests OK.
- 33 smoke/auth tests OK.
- Django check OK.
- No migration changes.
- Production anonymous calendar access redirects to login.

## Recent Emergency Fixes Already Completed

### Weekly report schedule import amounts

Problem:

- Weekly report create page loaded quote/delivery schedules without amounts.

Main changes:

- `reporting/views.py`
- `reporting/templates/reporting/weekly_report/form.html`
- tests in `reporting/tests.py`

Commit:

- `d006234 fix: include weekly report quote delivery amounts`

Deployment:

- `web`: `77680da9-7b6a-4619-ada2-c289527534af`

### Weekly report double-escaped rich text HTML

Problem:

- Weekly report fields were saved as escaped nested HTML like `<p>&lt;p&gt;...`.

Main changes:

- `reporting/utils_html.py`
- weekly report form normalization JS
- tests in `reporting/tests.py`

Commits:

- `aa73921 fix: normalize weekly report rich text html`
- `880bf1e docs: record weekly report urgent fixes`

Deployments:

- `web`: `56b8c632-14aa-4989-aeca-f422e06e7a43`
- final docs deployment: `3e09d3f7-5068-4544-84f2-f413b09ceded`

User result:

- User manually tested and said the result was good.

### Customer AI analysis quote/delivery context

Problem:

- React customer detail `/customers/454/` could run AI analysis, but GPT did not know about existing quote/delivery records when those records were stored as schedules and delivery items.

Main changes:

- `ai_chat/services.py`
- `ai_chat/tests.py`
- `reporting/templates/reporting/base.html`
- `AGENT_PLAN.md`
- `AGENT_REPORT.md`

Implemented behavior:

- AI quote/delivery context now includes:
  - `Quote` + `QuoteItem`
  - quote schedules: `Schedule(activity_type='quote')` + `DeliveryItem(schedule=...)`
  - quote histories: `History(action_type='quote')`
  - delivery histories: `History(action_type='delivery_schedule')`
  - delivery schedules: `Schedule(activity_type='delivery')` + `DeliveryItem(schedule=...)`
- Avoids double-counting delivery schedules already represented by linked histories.
- `gather_followup_data()` uses the same quote/delivery collection path for individual customer analysis.
- Prompt includes source labels, item names, amounts, and notes.

Commits:

- `dbf4f33 fix: include quote delivery data in AI analysis`
- `6fce7a8 docs: record AI quote delivery deployment`

Deployments:

- functional deploy: `1dcdd01e-1495-4f9f-80d6-c430da5bd876`
- final docs deploy: `101b9590-5b8b-4624-96d4-6efba599dd82`

Important limitation:

- Existing saved AI analysis results do not auto-refresh.
- The user must run AI analysis again from `/customers/<id>/` to generate a new result with quote/delivery context.

## AI Verification Memory Work Already Completed

Recent commits before the latest emergency tasks:

- `8c870ee feat: remember AI painpoint verification`
- `59e8ba4 docs: record AI verification memory deployment`
- `47679b7 feat: apply AI verification memory to insights`
- `b0c485b docs: record AI verification insights deployment`

Purpose:

- PainPoint verification notes are now remembered and used in GPT context.
- Verification memory should influence:
  - new AI analysis
  - summaries
  - next-action insights
  - repeated verification questions

Important follow-up:

- When continuing AI React migration, keep the verification memory visible and actionable in the React result/verification flow.

## Current Navigation Policy

Django common sidebar should point to Django pages during transition:

- Dashboard: `/reporting/dashboard/`
- Customers: `/reporting/followups/`
- AI: `/ai/`
- Schedule calendar: `/reporting/schedules/calendar/`
- Notes: `/reporting/histories/`
- Pipeline: `/reporting/funnel/pipeline/`

React remains accessible through top quick links such as `프론트 CRM`.

React pages should continue to expose Django fallback/original links until feature parity is done.

## Recommended Next Work

Current latest work:

- React weekly reports first integration is implemented, pushed, deployed, and smoke-tested.
- Runtime commit: `8c9fdb6 feat: add React weekly reports`.
- Railway `web`: `4216824a-7d1f-4850-8624-11dca0b40b26` SUCCESS.
- Railway `sales-note-frontend`: `fd8547fc-63f8-4962-92de-88b182eb7984` SUCCESS.
- Deployed bundle: `assets/index-D6rGbRO3.js` / `assets/index-CjVBFS4u.css`.
- Changed files: `AGENT_PLAN.md`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/api.ts`, `frontend/src/styles.css`, `reporting/views.py`, `reporting/urls.py`, `reporting/tests.py`.
- Local validation passed: weekly report tests, `npm run build`, `node --check server.mjs`, `python manage.py check`, `python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run`, `git diff --check`.
- Production smoke passed: `/weekly-reports/` returns 200, protected weekly report APIs return 401 anonymous, deployed JS/CSS contain the weekly report route/styles.

Wait for user manual production verification before starting the next implementation task. Natural next slices after confirmation are:

1. Move 견적/문서 생성 workflows into React.
2. React schedule calendar parity audit and fallback links.
3. Continue customer AI result verification UI in React.

Alternative high-value slice:

- React schedule calendar parity audit and fallback links, because Django schedule calendar is heavily used. Do not remove Django calendar until React can cover the real operational workflow.

## Files To Read Before Continuing

Required project guidance:

1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
3. `SALES_CRM_SPEC.md`
4. `QA_CHECKLIST.md`
5. `AGENT_PLAN.md`
6. `AGENT_REPORT.md`

Likely implementation files:

- `ai_chat/services.py`
- `ai_chat/views.py`
- `ai_chat/urls.py`
- `ai_chat/tests.py`
- `reporting/views.py`
- `reporting/urls.py`
- `reporting/tests.py`
- `reporting/templates/reporting/base.html`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/styles.css`
- `frontend/README.md`
- `reporting/templates/reporting/prepayment/list.html`
- `reporting/templates/reporting/prepayment/detail.html`

## Validation Baseline

Use targeted tests first, then broader checks depending on scope.

Common commands:

```powershell
python manage.py check
python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
python manage.py test ai_chat.tests --verbosity=1
python manage.py test reporting.tests.CustomersSummaryApiTests --verbosity=1
python manage.py test reporting.tests.AuthenticationSmoke reporting.tests.DashboardSmokeTests reporting.tests.AnonymousAccessTests --verbosity=1
```

For React frontend changes:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
npm run build
node --check server.mjs
```

## Production Smoke Checklist

Anonymous protection:

```powershell
curl.exe -I -s https://web-production-5096.up.railway.app/reporting/schedules/calendar/
curl.exe -I -s https://web-production-5096.up.railway.app/reporting/login/
curl.exe -i -s https://sales-note-frontend-production.up.railway.app/reporting/api/customers/454/
```

Expected:

- protected Django template pages redirect to `/reporting/login/`
- protected API routes return login-required behavior
- login page returns 200

Railway:

```powershell
railway status
railway deployment list --service web --environment production --limit 5 --json
railway deployment list --service sales-note-frontend --environment production --limit 5 --json
```

## Deployment Notes

- Backend/Django changes usually deploy through Railway service `web`.
- React bundle/server changes deploy through Railway service `sales-note-frontend`.
- Docs-only commits can still trigger Railway deploys. If pushed, wait for the final deployment to become `SUCCESS`.
- The latest runtime commit documented at handoff is:

```text
b345687 fix: simplify AI painpoint verification
```

## Known Caveats

- Local PowerShell profile emits noisy `Set-PSReadLineOption` warnings in command output. These have not indicated task failure.
- Local environment may warn that `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset. This is expected locally unless testing IMAP/SMTP encryption paths.
- Some old README content still mentions older Node/Express planning text. Treat `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and `SALES_CRM_SPEC.md` as higher priority.
- Do not expose CRM data publicly.
- Do not weaken authentication, CSRF, session, or AI permission checks.
- Do not remove Django templates yet.

## User Manual Test Status

Confirmed by user:

- React dashboard logout button: confirmed complete.
- Weekly report urgent fixes: good.
- Django schedule calendar restoration: confirmed complete.
- React schedule calendar: confirmed complete.
- React schedule documents: confirmed complete.

Needs awareness:

- React mailbox email line-break normalization is deployed and awaits user manual production testing.
- React schedule calendar report content/nav-first calendar entry is deployed and awaits user manual production testing.
- AI PainPoint verification memo confirm-only change is deployed and awaits user manual production testing.
- React document template management `/documents/` is deployed and awaits user manual production testing.
- AI department meeting scope fix is deployed; existing stored AI analysis results require rerun to include coworker department meetings.
- React pipeline department AI panel is deployed and can be manually tested.
- React customer detail prepayment summary is deployed and awaits user manual production testing.
- AI quote/delivery context fix is deployed, but existing stored AI results require rerun. If validating customer `454`, click AI analysis again and inspect the new output.

## Previous Completed Work: React Schedule Calendar

User confirmed the weekly report flow works except the `일정 불러오기` button needed to be on the right. That position fix was implemented first, built, committed previously as `2d02547 fix: move weekly schedule loader panel`, pushed, deployed to `sales-note-frontend` deployment `c9d534dd-8e6b-4943-8af2-89f9d643f004`, and smoke-tested (`/weekly-reports/new/` 200, JS/CSS bundle contains `weekly-schedule-load`).

The next implementation completed is React schedule calendar first integration:

- Added `/reporting/api/schedules/calendar/` authenticated JSON API.
- Added date range parsing, same-company data filters (`me`, `all`, `user`), user options, and calendar metrics.
- Added React API type/loader `ScheduleCalendarData` and `loadScheduleCalendarData`.
- Added React `/schedules/calendar/` route with month navigation, data filter, monthly grid, selected-day panel, and Django fallback links.
- Changed React schedule calendar links from `/reporting/schedules/calendar/` to `/schedules/calendar/` where React screens own the UX.
- Kept Django `/reporting/schedules/calendar/` and `/reporting/schedules/api/` intact.
- No DB model changes.

- `dist/assets/index-BJ8JCI1J.css`

Production smoke passed:

- `https://sales-note-frontend-production.up.railway.app/schedules/calendar/` returns 200.
- deployed JS contains `schedule-calendar-page`, `/reporting/api/schedules/calendar/`, and `weekly-schedule-load`.
- deployed CSS contains `.schedule-calendar-grid`, `.schedule-calendar-day`, and `.weekly-schedule-load`.
- anonymous frontend-proxied API and direct backend API `/reporting/api/schedules/calendar/` return `401 login_required`.

Manual test requested from user:

1. Open `https://sales-note-frontend-production.up.railway.app/schedules/calendar/`.
2. Verify month navigation and today highlight.
3. Verify `내 일정`, `회사 전체`, `직원 선택` filters.
4. Click a scheduled date and verify right-side selected-day list.
5. Open a customer schedule and a personal schedule from the list.
6. Confirm `Django 캘린더` fallback still works.
7. Recheck `/weekly-reports/new/` has `일정 불러오기` in the right schedule panel.
